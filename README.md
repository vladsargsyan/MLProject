# MLProject

# Introduction to the project
This project aims to show:
- Loading the dataset.
- Summarizing the dataset.
- Visualizing the dataset.
- Evaluating some algorithms.
- Making some predictions.

# How to open an IPYNB file.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/vladsargsyan/MLProject.git
2. Install Jupyter Notebook on your workstation. Alternatively, open the application if Jupyter Notebook is already installed
3. Double-click the Tips.ipynb file in the Jupyter application. This should open the IPYNB file in a separate tab. Running each time you will get different output as the test size is 30% of the existing data.

 # Used libraries
- Pandas is used to analyze data.
- Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib.
- Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks where the goal is to predict the probability that an instance belongs to a given class or not.
- Gaussian Naive Bayes is a type of Naive Bayes method where continuous attributes are considered and the data features follow a Gaussian distribution throughout the dataset.
- The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a supervised machine learning method employed to tackle classification and regression problems.
